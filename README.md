# node-1-minute-app
:coffee: A (very) basic Node.js app I wrote in 1 minute, just to see if I could!

To run: 
Install git: https://git-scm.com/
Install npm: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
Install node: https://nodejs.org/en/

Download this repo, open folder with Git Bash (or Terminal on Mac)

type "npm install express" into the CLI

type "node app.js"

open a browser to localhost:3000 to see the live app.
